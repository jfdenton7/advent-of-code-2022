### Advent of Code 2022

Using this advent to learn c++ and the cmake build system.
This is in preparation for OMSCS at GT.


### Resources 
A few helpful resources I used along the way.

- [CMakeLists.txt example proj](https://gitlab.com/CLIUtils/modern-cmake/-/blob/master/examples/extended-project/src/CMakeLists.txt)
- [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [gist for .gitignore c++](https://gist.github.com/Yousha/3830712334ac30a90eb6041b932b68d7)
